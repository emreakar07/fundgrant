      question: "How does your solution align with EU Green Deal objectives?",
      answer:
        "Our EcoStore technology directly supports multiple EU Green Deal objectives: (1) Climate neutrality by enabling higher renewable energy adoption, (2) Clean energy transition by solving the storage challenge, (3) Circular economy through our use of recyclable materials and modular design, and (4) Zero pollution via our non-toxic components and manufacturing processes.",
    },
    {
      question: "What is your competitive advantage compared to existing solutions?",
      answer:
        "EcoStore offers three key advantages over competitors: (1) Cost efficiency - 40% lower levelized cost of storage compared to lithium-ion batteries, (2) Environmental performance - 85% lower carbon footprint in manufacturing and zero toxic materials, and (3) Scalability - modular design allows for deployment in various settings from residential to utility-scale with minimal customization.",
